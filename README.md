# Banking System
## Description
This banking system is a play on real bank's systems. Using *mongoDB* in *python*, the user can easily connect to the server and start making some transactions.
## How to use
First of all, make sure you have all the required libraries installed by running `pip install requirements.txt` in your command line.
After the installation is over, you can go ahead and run *server.py* (either by running *run-server.bat* or typing `python server.py` in your command line). Do the same thing in order to run *client.py*. Now you can go ahead and type *help* in your client side, and start using commands.
